//Make a program that reads a seller's name, his/her fixed salary and the sale's total made by himself/herself in the month (in money). Considering that this seller receives 15% over all products sold, write the final salary (total) of this seller at the end of the month , with two decimal places.

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
    char name;
    double salary,extra,TOTAL;
    scanf("%s %lf %lf",&name,&salary,&extra);
    
    TOTAL = salary + (0.15*extra) ;
    
    printf("TOTAL = R$ %.2lf\n",TOTAL);

     
    return 0;
}
